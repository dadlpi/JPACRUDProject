# JPACRUDProject
The purpose of this project was to show a full stack application that could successfully perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete). We were free to select the type of application we wanted to build from the Database tables all the way to the Java Objects as well as the model view controller functionality. No restrictions were placed on this project so long as the application could perform the intended CRUD functionality.

# Description:
I chose to write an "Auto Maintenance Job" application to keep track of auto maintenance and auto repair jobs that should be performed at intervals. The application currently presents automotive jobs that currently sit in the Database as well, the application also has the ability to take in new job names and store them in the Database. Furthermore, you could select an individual job by it's name to enter a details screen where you as the user can get more information as well as update the job descriptions and if need be you can even delete the job from the database via a web page.

# Technologies Used:
1. Java version 1.17
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. Mysql-connector-java (JDBC) version 8.0.30
4. Spring Boot Framework version 5.3.22
5. Model View Controller Architecture
6. Tomcat Web Server
7. Java Servlet and .jsp
8. JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library version 1.2
9. Eclipse Integrated Development Environment
10. Boot CSS

# Lessons Learned:
This exercise allowed me to tie in all the disciplines we have been learning so far. The most beneficial part of this exercise was being able to design my own database as the way I thought it would be best for my intended application as well as being able to exercise using HTML form functionality and tying it to the Spring controller to utilize it's data.
